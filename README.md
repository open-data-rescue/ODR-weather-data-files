# ODR-weather-data-files
Here are the files with historical weather data from ODR projects

This repository contains data files and programs from ODR projects. They are in SEF (station exchange format) and CSV format. The CSV format is in the original units and as close as possible to the original document. The SEF files are written as closely as possible to the C3S_DC3S311a_Lot1.2.1_2018_Guidelines for inventory metadata v1 standards. Where necessary new standrds and formats are developed using WMO guidelines, the International Cloud Atlas guidelines, and the Canadian Synoptic Weather Codes.

The programs to write the SEF files, which also contain the verfication, validation and unit transformation, are also in this repository, along with station metadata.
