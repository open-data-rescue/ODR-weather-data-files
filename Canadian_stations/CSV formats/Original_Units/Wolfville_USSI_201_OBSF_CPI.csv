A very fine exhibition of aurora occurred this evening. It commenced very soon after sunset and continued until midnight and perhaps longer. The sky was remarkably clear, and what was peculiar, the segment under the arch usually of a dark hue, was of a bright azure color, and so clear that stars in it were as distinctly visible as in other parts of the heavens",The height of the arch was variable - the angle being for the most part unusually large and towards midnight as much as 70 or 75 degrees. At intervals the whole northern part of the heavens above the segment was a blaze of light.,"The streamers were of various tints, mostly yellow and red. A few feeble rays darting up in one quarter of the heavens would soon expand into a magnficient sheet of light and move rapidly to the opposite quarter.","Sometimes appearing far down in the clear segment beneath the arch, the rays would increase in brightness, until like a vast curtain, undulating in huge folds of yellow, white and rozy light, they streamed to the zenith. One fact, which I was not fortunate enough myself to witness, was spoken of by many as the most extraordinary and beautiful part of the exhibition. It occurred in the early part of the evening and was described as being a brilliant exhibition of light in the zenith. It was probably the corona or crown., no very fine exhibition of which I saw during the evening. Towards midnight, when the arch was very high and the light pale, the streamers seemed to be very way over the earth and moved with great velocity and in undulations like large waves of the sea. Some thought they could hear sounds, I heard nothing but the [illegible] of leaves in the light breeze. The moon shone bright, but notwithstanding its light it was one of the finest Auroras I ever saw.",.
