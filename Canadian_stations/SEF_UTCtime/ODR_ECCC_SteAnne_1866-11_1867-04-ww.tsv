Hence the real difficulty of keeping navigation open in winter on the St. Lawrence. It is not altogether its cold but the rapidity with which this strong ice forms between  high and low water on a flat coast that causes the scarcity of harbors on its shore which could be permanently kept opened for winter navigation. mno|Local time: daily|QC flag: None|Image File: SteAnne_USSI-401_M1958_1867-04-01_CP.jpg
